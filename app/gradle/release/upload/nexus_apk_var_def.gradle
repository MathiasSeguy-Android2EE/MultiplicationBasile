    //way as with the project’s root java package) which can be com, net, org… Example

//version: Identifier of the version to build. There are two different types: the first type is a normal
//version number, the other type is a Snapshot. By convention for a normal version number, the
//identifier should be:
//<major version>.<minor version>.<incremental version>-<qualifier>
//This, for example, would give us 2.1.0-alpha. The qualifier is not mandatory, the other elements are
//highly recommended. The Snapshot version type is in fact a kind of syntax that allows you to build
//versions (typically during the over-night build) that are named in function of the date on which the
//build took place. This syntax is to be used in a project under development that has not yet reached a
//version but is performing builds on a regular basis (either with continuous integration, or by opening
    //up the source for other modules or projects).
